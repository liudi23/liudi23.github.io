I'm a full-stack developer and ML/MLOps engineer based in London, UK. My work revolves around designing and deploying scalable AI systems, integrating data science insights into robust applications.

Over the years, I've contributed to various projects, from developing end-to-end machine learning pipelines to building user-centric web applications. My expertise lies in bridging the gap between complex data models and real-world applications.

Beyond coding, I actively participate in tech communities, sharing knowledge through talks and workshops. I'm always eager to collaborate on innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology.
