Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- **MLOps Pipeline Automation**: Implemented CI/CD pipelines for machine learning models, streamlining the deployment process and reducing time-to-production.

- **Data Visualization Dashboard**: Created an interactive dashboard for real-time data analytics, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.

- **Scalable Web Application**: Built a full-stack web application using React and Node.js, handling thousands of concurrent users efficiently.

Each project reflects my commitment to integrating AI solutions into practical applications. More details and code repositories are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/maciejkozubal).
